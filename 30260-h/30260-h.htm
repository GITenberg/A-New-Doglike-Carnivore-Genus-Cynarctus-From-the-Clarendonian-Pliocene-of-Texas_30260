<p>A study of a right maxilla bearing P3-M1 and part of a right
mandibular ramus bearing m2 (see figures) reveals the existence of
an unnamed species of cynarctine carnivore. It may be known as:</p>

<h3><b>Cynarctus fortidens</b> new species</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Holotype.</i>&mdash;Right maxilla bearing P3, P4, and M1, No. 11353 KU; bluff
on west side of Turkey Creek, approximately 75 feet above stream, Raymond
Farr Ranch, Center NE, NE, S. 48 Blk. C-3, E. L. and R. R. Ry. Co.,
Donley County, Texas [approximately 6.5 miles north and 1 mile east of
Clarendon], Clarendon fauna, Early Pliocene age. Obtained by W. W. Dalquest,
on June 25, 1960.</p>

<p><i>Referred material.</i>&mdash;Fragment of right lower mandible bearing m2, No.
11354 KU (see fig. 2), found about two feet horizontally distant from the
holotype in the same stratum as the holotype and on the same date by the
same collector (a staff member of the Department of Biology of Midwestern
University, Wichita Falls, Texas).</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;Size large (see measurements); no accessory cusp between
protocone and paracone of fourth upper premolar; first upper molar longer than
broad and lacking cingulum on part of tooth lingual to protocone.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;From <i>Cynarctus crucidens</i> Barbour and Cook (see page 225
of Two New Fossil Dogs of the Genus Cynarctus from Nebraska. Nebraska
Geol. Surv., 4(pt. 15):223-227, 1914; also pages 330 and 338 of Dental
Morphologie of the Procyonidae with a Description of Cynarctoides, Gen.
Nov. Geol. Ser. Field Mus. Nat. Hist., 6:323-339, 10 figs., October 31, 1938)
<i>C. fortidens</i> differs in lacking, instead of having, an accessory cusp between
the protocone and paracone of the fourth upper premolar and in lacking, instead
of having, a cingulum on the part of P4 that is internal (lingual) to the
protocone.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The lower jaw and its second molar seem to be from an individual
significantly larger than the holotype. Possibly the lower jaw and
upper jaw are from two species but the lower jaw probably is from a male
and the upper jaw from a female of the same species.</p>

<p>Reasons for regarding <i>Cynarctus</i> as belonging to the family Canidae instead
of to the family Procyonidae have been stated recently in detail by E. C.
Galbreath (Remarks on <i>Cynarctoides acridens</i> from the Miocene of Colorado.
Trans. Kansas Acad. Sci., 59(3):373-378, 1 fig., October 31, 1956) and need
not be repeated here. Although some uncertainty remains as to the familial
position of <i>Cynarctus</i>, we favor Galbreath's view that the genus belongs in
the family Canidae.</p>

<p>The holotype of <i>Cynarctus crucidens</i> is from Williams Canyon, Brown
County, Nebraska. According to C. B. Schultz (<i>in litt.</i>, December 6, 1961),
Williams Canyon is a tributary of Plumb Creek; the upper part of the Valentine
formation and the younger lower part of the Ash Hollow formation are
exposed in Williams Canyon; which one of these formations yielded the holotype
of <i>C. crucidens</i> is unknown.</p>

<p>On the basis of the correlation chart (Pl. 1 in Nomenclature and Correlation
of the North American Continental Tertiary. Bull. Geol. Soc. Amer.,
52(pt. 1):1-48, 1941) by H. E. Wood 2nd <i>et al.</i>, <i>C. fortidens</i> and <i>C. crucidens</i>
are equivalent in age or <i>C. fortidens</i> is the younger.</p>

<p>The rounded summits of the principal cusps of the teeth of <i>C. fortidens</i>
suggests that it was mainly frugivorous instead of carnivorous&mdash;more frugivorous
by far than the living gray fox, <i>Urocyon cinereoargenteus</i>, that is
known to eat substantial amounts of fruits and berries. Indeed, no other
canid that we know of has teeth so much adapted to a frugivorous diet as
are those of <i>C. fortidens</i>. Its degree of adaptation to a frugivorous diet is
more than in the procyonid genus <i>Nasua</i> but less than in the procyonid genus
<i>Bassaricyon</i>.</p></div>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
